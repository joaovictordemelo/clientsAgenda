# clientsAgenda

Hi, we, from Adamastor Booking, need the following files to work greatly, 
which are the edit, the menu, the signup, the agendaShow, dbh.inc and 
process. We also have to say that we use the MySQL phpMyadmin, so that the
table will be stored there, with id, name, email, job, market, phone and 
address as fields to be fullfilled. In addiction to let everything with a 
sense o style, we include the waves.css
